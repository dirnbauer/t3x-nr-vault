# ADR 0002: Credential Sets are a typed semantic layer that references `tx_nrvault_secret` (no replacement)

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-01-12

## Context

nr-vault currently stores atomic secrets (single values). Real integrations often require a set of related fields (e.g. OAuth2 client credentials: client_id, client_secret, token_url, scopes). Managing these as separate secrets is error-prone and lacks semantic validation.

We need a “Credential Set” concept while preserving the existing `tx_nrvault_secret` primitive and its encryption/audit semantics.

## Decision

We will introduce a new table/concept `tx_nrvault_credential_set` and define:

- `tx_nrvault_secret` remains the **primitive encrypted storage unit** (atomic, type-agnostic).
- `tx_nrvault_credential_set` becomes a **typed wrapper** that references exactly **one** secret row via `secret_uid`.
- The referenced secret contains an **encrypted JSON payload** holding all credential fields for the set.

Credential sets do **not** replace `tx_nrvault_secret`. They build on top of it.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Reuses nr-vault’s encryption, ACL, and audit model without duplication.
- A credential set becomes the stable reference target for the Service Registry.
- Rotation becomes straightforward: update one credential set = update one encrypted payload.
- Simplifies Rust transport integration: pass one ciphertext payload instead of N.

### Negative
- Fine-grained per-field ACL inside one credential set is not supported (acceptable: if you can use the credential set, you can use its fields).
- Requires a migration/import story for existing scattered secrets.

## Alternatives considered

1) **Parent-child secrets model:** credential set as parent, multiple child secrets.  
   - Rejected for MVP: more joins and complexity; awkward for FFI integration (multiple blobs); unclear audit semantics.

2) **Store encrypted blob directly in `tx_nrvault_credential_set`** (no secret FK).  
   - Rejected: duplicates encryption/audit logic and creates two competing secret stores.

3) **Metadata-only linking** (tags).  
   - Rejected: weak referential integrity; too easy to break.
